              <p class="text-muted">For this project, we were tasked with applying our knowledge of an instructional design theory and model to design and develp a tutorial or aid that would be used to teach someone a skill.
              I decided to that I would create a tutorial for understanding how to create ArrayLists in Java, and how to access, modify, and remove elements from them. This project is still a work in progress.

              <p class="mt-3 text-muted">Through this project, I learned how to apply ID theories and models to something more familiar - a computer science lecture. Previously when I created learning objectives, I was either too broad,
                or too specific. By using the ABCD model to craft an objective, I was able to define an objective that was specific enough and measurable.</p>
              <p class="mt-3 text-muted">There are two ways I feel I could improve this project. Firtly, I would try and create an learning objective that could be categorized in a higher level in Blooms Taxonomy. The content for learning how to work with ArrayLists
              is knowledge that can be easily repeated and replicated. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, but because programmers frequently refer to the internet for help with syntax, I feel that true skill in programming
              is gained when learners can use what is avaible to them in a creative way and defend their code such as why they used an array versus and ArrayList in a certain circumstance.
              <br>Secondly, I would increase the recording time by a few minutes so the video does not seem as rushed. On YouTube, there is a functionality for adding timestamps or "chapters," and I think this is a perfect video to utilize chapters since
              there are multiple sections of this video. Even if the video was 10 minutes, I feel it would be more beneficial to have a longer video with sections rather than a rushed shorter video."</p>
