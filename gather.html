              <p class="text-muted">For this assignment, we were tasked to create a Flipsnack to discuss our understanding of the Diffusion of Innovation Theory to answer a few questions. I chose to use
                a personal scenario of how I was part of a team that used Gather.town to conduct an Intro to Computer Science course at UNC Charlotte a year after COVID-19 forced us to online emergency remote learning.
                In this Flipsnack, I describe some of the challenges faced with remote synchronous meetings and how we attempted to conquer those challenges with students who were hesitant to use Gather.town rather than Zoom or other
                conferencing software/applications. </p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-muted">One way I could have improved this project would be by limiting the amount of words I use on each page. Because this Flipsnack was used to respond to provided discussion questions,
                I attempted to provide the text needed to answer the question; however, looking back, I feel as if I put too many words on each page. I would shorten my sentences, cut out any unnecessary or superfluous information,
                and provide more whitespace and graphics to balance the text I do provide to be easier for readers/learners to digest and look through.
