              <p class="text-muted">In this assignment, we were tasked to select one aspect of Learning, Design &amp; Technology, and create a timeline of it. I chose to make my timeline on
                <strong>The History of Projection Technology</strong> since projectors and other visual tools such as televisions and mobile devices (laptops, phones, tablets) are an important
                part of how we integrate technology into the classroom.<br>
              <strong>Tools Used:</strong> Sutori</p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-muted">This timeline was the first assignment in this class and it allowed me to utilize a new technology, Sutori, which is a collaborative instruction and presentation tool.
                 From this project, I learned how recent projection technology came to light and who we can give credit to for the technology we commonly use in classrooms. It also is inspiring to imagine all
                 the potential inventions in the future that are yet to be created. There's so much potential for more portable, clearer, and more interactive technologies that use projection.
                </p>
              <p class="mt-3 text-muted">If I could improve this project I would have went a little more in-depth on each of the technologies so I could learn more, and I would look more into the future
                of projection technology beyond what I added. I would have also added more interactive features to engage readers/learners more than what is already included. </p>
