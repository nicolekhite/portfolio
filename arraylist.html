              <p class="text-muted">For this project, we were tasked with applying our knowledge of an instructional design theory and model to design and develp a tutorial or aid that would be used to teach someone a skill.
                I decided to that I would create a tutorial for understanding how to create ArrayLists in Java, and how to access, modify, and remove elements from them. The documentation for this assignment can be found
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wylzt6GABYItocJvjWNuRZY-47xSIA77/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, and the video can be found below.
                <br><strong>Tools utilized</strong>: Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, Netbeans 8.2, Loom</p>
              <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/a3415160ac4944579aaf053b9d91f369" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
              <p class="mt-3 text-muted">Through this project, I learned how to apply ID theories and models to something more familiar - a computer science lecture. Previously when I created learning objectives, I was either too broad,
                or too specific. By using the ABCD model to craft an objective, I was able to define an objective that was specific enough and measurable.</p>
              <p class="mt-3 text-muted">There are two ways I feel I could improve this project. Firtly, I would try and create an learning objective that could be categorized in a higher level in Blooms Taxonomy. The content for learning how to
                work with ArrayLists
                is knowledge that can be easily repeated and replicated. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, but because programmers frequently refer to the internet for help with syntax, I feel that true skill in programming
                is gained when learners can use what is avaible to them in a creative way and defend their code such as why they used an array versus and ArrayList in a certain circumstance.
                <br>Secondly, I feel that I attemped to put too much content in too short of a video. I would have liked to increase the recording time by a few minutes so the video does not seem as rushed, but for this project,
                we needed to make a short video. On YouTube, there is a functionality for adding timestamps or "chapters," and I think this is a perfect video to utilize
                chapters since there are multiple sections of this video. Even if the video was 10 minutes, I feel it would be more beneficial to have a longer video with
                sections rather than a rushed shorter video.</p>
